## Usage

## Folder structure

This template follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.  
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `constants`: Folder to store any kind of constant that you have.
  - `localization`: Folder to store the languages files.
  - `navigation`: Folder to store the navigators.
  - `reducers`: This folder should have all your reducers, and expose the combined result using its `index.js`
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
    - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside its folder and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests.
      - `Screen.js`
      - `Screen.styles.js`
      - `Screen.test.js`
  - `storage`: Folder that contains the application storage logic.
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
  - `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
  - `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.
